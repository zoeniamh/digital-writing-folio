# week one
## initial thoughts
<p> todayyyy was a lot. i think once we get into it a bit more i'll be able to grasp it. i'm used to downlaoding stuff and modding games but this is a whole different ball park. dad'll be able to help if i ask - it'l be fine. i'm exctied to get to the actual writing part, and at the concept of making a website for my writing - consolidating everything into one, very me-vibe, space. right now it's veryyyy overwhelming but idk we'll get there. i hope lol </p>
