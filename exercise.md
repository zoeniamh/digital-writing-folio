# Week One
## Initial thoughts and reflections
<p> Today was a lot. I think once we get into it a bit more I'll be able to grasp it. I'm used to downlaoding stuff and modding games but this is a whole different ball park. My Dad - who is very techy - should be able to help if I ask, which is always comforting. I'm exctied to get to the actual writing part, and at the concept of making a website for my writing - consolidating everything into one, very me-vibe, space. Right now it's very overwhelming but I know we'll get there. I hope! </p>

## Questions

### Digital Writing
- What do you think digital writing is?
<p> I think digital writing is simply work displayed in a digital form, on websites, or even video games.</p>

- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
<p> I honestly don't have many expectations for this lab, as it is very different from what I thought this was going to be. But in saying that, I hope to glean a better understanding on how to bring my work into the digital age, and maybe even see if this is something I would like to continue to work with.</p>

### Your Writing
- What types of writing do you do?
<p> I strongly lean towards writing fiction novels and poetry. But since being introduced to it throughout this course, I've got a new love for auto-fiction as well!</p>

- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
<p> I love to use poetic prose as much as I can, often my writing has a lyrical quality to it. I also often have themse of nature and family within my writing.</p>

- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
<p> I don't really know to be 100% honest. I've always just felt a connection with these tools. I find writing a very intuitive practice, so these have always come naturally to me.</p>

- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
<p> This intuitive approach to writing is both a major win, but also a huge constraint. Of course, when insperation strikes, the words tend to flow. This of course, has another face. I can find myself paralysed and unable to write.</p>
