# Week One
## Initial thoughts and reflections
<p> Today was a lot. I think once we get into it a bit more I'll be able to grasp it. I'm used to downlaoding stuff and modding games but this is a whole different ball park. My Dad - who is very techy - should be able to help if I ask, which is always comforting. I'm exctied to get to the actual writing part, and at the concept of making a website for my writing - consolidating everything into one, very me-vibe, space. Right now it's very overwhelming but I know we'll get there. I hope! </p>

## Questions

### Digital Writing
- What do you think digital writing is?
<p> I think digital writing is simply work displayed in a digital form, on websites, or even video games.</p>

- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
<p> I honestly don't have many expectations for this lab, as it is very different from what I thought this was going to be. But in saying that, I hope to glean a better understanding on how to bring my work into the digital age, and maybe even see if this is something I would like to continue to work with.</p>

### Your Writing
- What types of writing do you do?
<p> I strongly lean towards writing fiction novels and poetry. But since being introduced to it throughout this course, I've got a new love for auto-fiction as well!</p>

- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
<p> I love to use poetic prose as much as I can, often my writing has a lyrical quality to it. I also often have themse of nature and family within my writing.</p>

- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
<p> I don't really know to be 100% honest. I've always just felt a connection with these tools. I find writing a very intuitive practice, so these have always come naturally to me.</p>

- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
<p> This intuitive approach to writing is both a major win, but also a huge constraint. Of course, when insperation strikes, the words tend to flow. This of course, has another face. I can find myself paralysed and unable to write.</p>

# Week Two

## Coding Playground

- What aspects of the remix are the same?
<p> I decided to keep the capsules relavtivly the same. I didn't want to bit off more than I could chew, and just wanted to enable myself to start to feel comfortable in the coding space, especially glitch as it seems really user friendly and I might be using it in the future (I know a few people who use it in the professional space). </p>
<p> I changed the writing of course, changing the main body of the pieces to my own. I also played around with different fonts, and changing the colours and photos within the capsules. I spent a lot of time on the style CSS sheet, and honestly found it really enjoyable. I like fiddly little things like that sometimes! I also decided to go against the rules of haiku, as I never really connected with this style of poem.</p>

- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
<p> For all intents and purposes, I think the remix was successful. I think if I went about it again there are a few things I would change, or even alter less - for example the notfication capsule, I accidently deleted a bit of code and now it's not actually clickable. However, I'm overall pretty happy with how it turned out, espescially seeing as it's my first attempt at coding anything. </p>

### Reflection
- How do you feel about coding now, versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
<p> Obviously, I still have a lot to learn. But in general, I'm starting to feel more and more confident. I feel as though I've expdanded my beliefs in what I'm able to pull off within this class. 
</p>

- Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?
<p> I think it's really just made me stop and think about it more. Now that I have actua hands-on experience with coding/creating e-lit, I have a deeper understanding of what actually goes into it, and how hard it can be. It can be quite fiddly, and honestly, fustrating. One small change can break the entire thing if you're not careful. It also made me realise just how hand-picked everything is, from searching for the perfect font on google fonts, or sorting through hex codes and trying them all oout to see how they feel within the piece. </p>

# Week Three
## To Make a Dadaist Poem
### In regard to Nick Monfort poem remix:
- What aspects of the remix are the same?
<p> There are words that tend to repeat, but this just comes down to the piece of writing I used, and the trends of my own writing. </p>

- What aspects are different?
<p> Most of the poem I created are different. I think this, again, comes down to the piece of writing I used to create the remix. It's an excerpt from a much longer piece of fiction that I recently wrote.</p>

- Is the remix successful?
<p> Honestly? No. I wouldn't say that this remix was successful. I find that no matter how many times I press the make a new poem button, the end result is often nonsensical. While I understand that most poems in this style have a certain vibe of nonsensical to them - I just think that mine pushes that too far.</p>

# Week Six
## 2024 Students' Works, Reflection
<p> Out of the three works we looked at today, I most connected with Snow Season. I think that this aligns really closly with my own practice as a writer, and had really inspired me for my own final work. Seeing that the piece was made on twine really solidified for me that that is the platform thaat I want ot use for my own work. Seeing how the student used pictures to aid the piece was really interesting, and I've already starting thinking on what images I could use with some of my writing to emulate something similar to this. The interactivy of the piece, while simple, is really effective. Having the words spread across the page ensures that the reader is able to get a full scope of the images. I also really enjoy how the last line/word on each page is the link to the next, as it really adds emphasis on that word, and makes the reader really think about why that's the final thing on the page and how this leads into the next.</p>

# Week Eight
## Reflection on Feeback and Peer presentations
### Rewritten, as I changed my piece after this presentation

- What are the themes and ideas that your piece is exploring?
<p> This piece is an exploration of grief, memory and the invisble ties that we have with loved ones even after they're gone. </p> 

- What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven, or more poetic and associative? Or Essayistic?
<p> I'm going to draaw on both poetic and associative styles for this piece. </p>

- Succinctly: What is the story? Or what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
<p> I want to be able to express how grief can linger and change over time. How grief plays into memories and how these have influence on current life. </p>

- What drives the reader's momentum through the piece?
<p> I'm hoping that the reader is able to draw some sort of personal connection/relation to the piece and thus be propelled forward to see where the subject of the poem ends up.</p>

- How does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the pieces thematic?
<p> I've implemented photos from the place in which a lot of the memories are from in hopes to evoke emotions that contribute to the piece. As well as this, each page has a different layout of words, in order to evoke the scattered feeling of old memories/lingering emotions. </p>

- Do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to anseer the above quesstions? How will you do this? By mapping? By wriitng it out?
<p> Honestly, the only thing that is worrying me is the line count. As I'm writing this, I'm sitting at about 50 lines. But I'm confident I'll be able to get this line count up if I just make myself sit down and lock in.</p>

# Week Nine
<p> Following the submisson of my presentation of my proposal, I recieved feedback that my piece and prototype pages were underdevloped. I honestly agree with this, and think it comes down to the fact I'm not connecting with my proposed piece, and thus, think I'm going to change directions. I have a poem, while very under the line count, that I think will work better for this task. I was told that my inspiation from Snow Season is clear, and I want to ensure that this stays the same. I have begun to work on mock-ups for this. </p>

# Week Ten
## Expectations
- What were your expectations coming into the class and what have you learnt?
<p> I honestly don't know what I expected. Definitely not this. I didn't expect to be coding in all honesty, I thought that bare minium, we'd be working on premade spaces/websites. Learning to code was daunting, and stressed me out to no end, particularly when we started on Glitch. In saying that, I feel a lot more confident now, having learnt basic coding.</p>

- How has your creative writing practice developed? Are there new directions? Or perhaps it has confirmed something about your practice as it was.
<p> This class has re-affired my passion for writing poetry. It showed me new ways to interact with poetry, giving me more creative spaces to share my work, and bleed into new genres of writing.</p>

- What particualr aspects of coding-based writing and e-lit might inform your practice from here on?
<p> I don't really plan on moving/taking my writing to the digital space in the future. While I had fun experimenting with digital writing, it just doesn't feel completely authentic to my pieces. In saying that, I think it was really good to learn how to make an author website, as now I have that to utilise whenever I may need.</p>
