## Before Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).
