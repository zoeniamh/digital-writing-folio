Read (on top of the weekly readings):

The kinetic poem "Taroko Gorge"
The electronic poem "The Gathering Cloud"
The hypertext fiction "First Draft of the Revolution"
The interactive fiction work "Shade"
"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the "Play IF card".
