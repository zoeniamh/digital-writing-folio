# Week One
### Carving in Possibilties by Deena Larsen, with sounds from Matt Hansen (vol. 1)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> Carving in Possibilites can be classified as a piece of digital writing due to the interactivity of it. It makes the reader interact with the piece as the only way to progress the story. This is done by moving your mouse across the screen, which not only causes new pieces of text to appear on the page, but also makes the image behind the text appear clearer.  </p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I really enjoyed the general interactivity of the piece, as it really draws me into the piece. However, I really don't like the soundscape added to it, it's loud and makes me quiet uneasy. I know that this may be the intention but I found myself having to turn the sound off when revisting the piece.</p>

### Fa√ßade by Micheal Mateas and Andrew Stern (vol. 2)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> This, to me, is a more classic take on what digital writing is. Or what I know it to be. I was first introduced to this piece through someone on social media, as they were playing through it and posting their reactions. It is, in this sense, I guess more of a game - but the writing going into it is what makes it lean towards digital writing/interactive fiction.</p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I love the playability of this one. It's so easy to make each experience completely different from the last. I also love the fact that I have no concpet of how this is done. Of course I'm still new to coding, so a lot still impresses me, but this one especially. I also enjoy just how much emotion is put into the characters, it can make you feel really uncomfortable at times - which is great.</p>

### First Draft of The Revolution by Emily Short and Liza Daly (vol. 3)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> This is a piece of digital writing, as it encourages readers to revise and rewrite the letters, in turn exposing more of the story and who the characters are.</p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I honestly just love the aesthetics of this piece, and that's what drew me to it in the first place.</p>

### The Infinite Woman by Katie Schaag (vol. 4)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> This piece classifies as digital writing, again due to the interactivity of it. It allows the reader to create their own poem, but choosing lines from Edison Marshall's novel The Infinite Woman (1950) and Simone de Beauvoir's philosophy book The Second Sex (1949). It uses a n-gram algorithm to procedurally generate an infinitely scrolling source of sentences to pull from.</p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I love the use of outside sources to create something new. I also like the fact that it's completely up to the reader to create their own poetry piece from the given sentences.</p>
