# Week One
### Carving in Possibilties by Deena Larsen, with sounds from Matt Hansen (vol. 1)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> Carving in Possibilites can be classified as a piece of digital writing due to the interactivity of it. It makes the reader interact with the piece as the only way to progress the story. This is done by moving your mouse across the screen, which not only causes new pieces of text to appear on the page, but also makes the image behind the text appear clearer.  </p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I really enjoyed the general interactivity of the piece, as it really draws me into the piece. However, I really don't like the soundscape added to it, it's loud and makes me quiet uneasy. I know that this may be the intention but I found myself having to turn the sound off when revisting the piece.</p>

### Fa√ßade by Micheal Mateas and Andrew Stern (vol. 2)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> This, to me, is a more classic take on what digital writing is. Or what I know it to be. I was first introduced to this piece through someone on social media, as they were playing through it and posting their reactions. It is, in this sense, I guess more of a game - but the writing going into it is what makes it lean towards digital writing/interactive fiction.</p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I love the playability of this one. It's so easy to make each experience completely different from the last. I also love the fact that I have no concpet of how this is done. Of course I'm still new to coding, so a lot still impresses me, but this one especially. I also enjoy just how much emotion is put into the characters, it can make you feel really uncomfortable at times - which is great.</p>

### First Draft of The Revolution by Emily Short and Liza Daly (vol. 3)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> This is a piece of digital writing, as it encourages readers to revise and rewrite the letters, in turn exposing more of the story and who the characters are.</p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I honestly just love the aesthetics of this piece, and that's what drew me to it in the first place.</p>

### The Infinite Woman by Katie Schaag (vol. 4)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?
<p> This piece classifies as digital writing, again due to the interactivity of it. It allows the reader to create their own poem, but choosing lines from Edison Marshall's novel The Infinite Woman (1950) and Simone de Beauvoir's philosophy book The Second Sex (1949). It uses a n-gram algorithm to procedurally generate an infinitely scrolling source of sentences to pull from.</p>

- What do you like about this piece? What don't you like?
<p> I love the use of outside sources to create something new. I also like the fact that it's completely up to the reader to create their own poetry piece from the given sentences.</p>

## Decolonize E-literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden
- This reading critiques the exclusivity of the e-literature field, questioning both academic and aesthetic constraints. It argues that it often excludes diverse voices, particuarly ones from social media or actvism. It advocates to bring in more diverse voices into the digital media space, which I agree is important and nessecary.

## Electronic Literature: What is it?
- Hayles defines e-literature as "digital born" works that utalise the capabilites of networked or stand alone computers. She empahsises the unique, interactive and multimodal nature of e-lit, statting that this is what sets it apart from classic digitlised media. Hayles calls for understanding e-lit as it's own form of literature, wanting to highlight and appreciate e-lits innovative forms and reader engagement. This essay helped me to broadan my perspective on e-literature, as I feel it strongly illustrated how digital writing/media can redfine storytelling.

# Week Two
## Digital poesis impluse
- Through practice based research, Jenny Hedley documents how GPT is able to assist in ideation, coding and execution of digital writning. This essay changed my view on the use of GPT. While of course I'm still really against using it for things like actually creating pieces of creative writing, it helped me with coming around to using it to create and fix coding or other digital writing problems.

# Week Three
- Reading Beyond Taxonomy alongside Motte's intro to Oulipo got me thinking about how I actually experience texts. Memmott talks about digital writing being something that is both messy and unpredicatable, as well as something that the reader directly interacts with instad of simply reading it. I personally like the idea of being able to explore the digital space myself, as it's honestly just something a little different from what I'm used to consuming.
- Oulipo though is really different, more concerned with setting constricting rules to spark creativity. Personally, I can't think of anything worse, often finding myself stuck when made to stick within tight rules when writing - for example high school writing prompts were always the death of any creative spark I may have had in class. But I see how this can be super intersting and engaging for other writers.

# Week Five
## What do you think of Aerseth's concept of Ergodic Literature?
- I found Espen Aerseth's idea of Ergodic Literature interesting, as it removes the traditional linear story telling structures, and instead treats the reader as a co-author, someone who had agency over the story they are reading. In hypertext, the readers interaction drives the story forward. Aerseth also challenges the idea that stories have to have a neat ending, turning away from the traditional one ending of a narrative and instead encourages multile endings. Each choice, having different combinations, leading to different endings, ensuring thst no two readers are going to experience the piece the exact same way. I find this such an interesting concept. I feel as though, already in classic literature, there can be so many different interpretations of the same text. Aerseth's approach to Ergodic Literature not only encourges this with the different endings, but ensures it.

# Week Six
## Reflection on Riddles
- This chapter made me think about how playfulness and mystery can be built into digital writing, and in a way that is completely different from traditonal narratives. Throughout this reading, the idea that digital texts can function like puzzles, having part of the reading being almost solvable by the reader, really focusing on uncovering the story through reader interaction. What really stands out to me is the idea that this kind of writing not only encourages be requires the reader to explore - click on things, have a scroll, get lost. It's all part of the charm, removinf the need for crystal clear narratives that are stuck on a linear track. It all comes back, for me, to the idea that digtial writing spaces allow for a kind of co-author ship, and I think it's really intersting and fun.

# Week Seven
## Reflection on Poetic Playlands
- This chapter discusses how e-lit texts are not just static words on a screen, but instead are multiple elements brought together - things like sound and visuals - to create a more immersive experience for the reader. It also made me reflect on how people engage with digital content on the daily; scrolling through websites, interacting with apps, or playing narrative-driven games. These all share similarities with e-literature, blurring the lines between simply reading and interacting. Overall, this chapter highlighted the ever evolving nature of literature in the digital space and how embracing these changes can lead to innovative and engaging storytelling forms.
